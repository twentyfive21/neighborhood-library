# Interesting piece of code : 
- I believe this piece of code is interesting since I connected the methods in my book class to the library class seamlessly. I have never done that type of implementation before so it was a fun learning experience. By using the setters and getters to handle everything in the book class I had less logic to do in the library class. Since all I had to pass was the name and my constructor handled the rest of the logic is was amazing to see how the application was working together. I enjoyed this alot! 
- User-Friendly: This application has a user-friendly interface by allowing users to select either 1-3 or yes or no when navigating through the program.
### Overall, this code demonstrates good practices in working with classes, constructors, and methods.
